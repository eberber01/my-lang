# my-lang

This is my attempt at creating a C compiler. The motivation for this is to learn about low level program creation and execution. I plan to apply this knowledge in the future by writing code that is effcient at the assembly level.


## Progress

    - Token lexing 
        - identifiers
        - positive integers
        - math operators
        - parenthesis
    - Math Expression parsing & eval

## Todo
    - Token lexing
        - float
        - double
        - negative integers
        - Keyword
    - RISC-V code gen
    - Symbol Table
